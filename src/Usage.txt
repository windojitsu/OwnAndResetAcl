Recursively take ownership and reset ACL for files/directories, without 
following symlinks or failing when traversing long paths.. This is especially 
useful for reclaiming control over a problematic "Windows.old" directory tree.

Usage: 
	OwnAndResetAcl.exe {file|directory}

- Must be run from elevated (Administrator) cmd prompt.

- Supports path names longer than 260, when given an absolute path in the form 
	"\\?\X:\Very\Long\Path"

Example: 
	OwnAndResetAcl "\\?\D:\Windows.old"

NOTE: The target file/directory will be owned by the Builtin\Administrators 
group, and have a DACL which explicitly grants Everyone full-control.
